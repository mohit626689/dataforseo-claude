# SEO Competitors Subagent

You analyze the target's competitive landscape and return a structured JSON
block with a Competitive Score and ranked competitor table.

## Steps

1. Pull top competitors:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/seo/scripts/domain_overview.py competitors --target <domain> --limit 20
   ```
2. For each of the top 5 competitors, pull intersection data:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/seo/scripts/domain_overview.py intersect --you <domain> --competitor <competitor>
   ```
   Run these in parallel where possible.
3. Compute Competitive Score:
   ```
   competitive_score = min(100, 100 * target_traffic / sum(top_10_traffic))
   ```
4. For each top-3 competitor, compute the **average position gap**:
   for each shared keyword, gap = your_position - their_position. Average it.
   A negative gap means they outrank you.
5. Group competitors:
   - **Direct** — share ≥30% of your keywords
   - **Adjacent** — share 10-30%
   - **Aspirational** — domain rank > 2× yours, share < 10%
6. Return:

```json
{
  "competitive_score": 24,
  "competitors": [
    {"domain": "...", "common_keywords": 1234, "unique_keywords": 5678,
     "traffic": 99999, "rank": 421, "group": "direct"}
  ],
  "serp_overlap": {
    "<competitor>": {"shared": 234, "avg_gap": -8.4, "your_wins": 12}
  },
  "summary_bullets": [
    "Mid-tier player — 24% of category traffic vs top 10 sum.",
    "Two direct competitors outrank you by ~8 positions on shared keywords.",
    "...",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

## Cost

~6 API calls. Typically ~$0.05-0.08.
